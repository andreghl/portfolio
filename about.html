        <div class="section">
          <p>
            I am an Economics Bachelor student at Maastricht University in the Netherlands.
            I developed an interest in Econometrics and Statistics and have, for this reason, included
            more Econometric courses in my curriculum. This blog is a place to write about to interests
            and to further improve my knowledge in hopes of pursuing a Master's in Econometric, Actuarial 
            Sciences, or a related field.

            <br /><em> Sept 2021 - Mar 2022</em><br /><br />
            Our project was to help people aged 60+ who were uncomfortable with
            new technologies to develop the skills needed to use their digital
            products on their own. Unfortenately, our project suffered due to
            the Covid-19 crisis. We decided to discontinue the project in early
            2022 to mitigate the risk of contamination (since we were dealing
            with a population at risk). This project was started thanks to the
            <a href="https://www.lje.be/fr">Les Jeunes Entreprises</a>
            initiative in Belgium.

            <b><em>Scope Maastricht - Database</em></b>
            <br /><em> Mar 2024 - Present </em><br /><br />
            <a href="https://scope-maastricht.nl/">Scope</a> is the study
            association of the school of Business and Economics of Maastricht
            University. The aim of the database committee is to create a single
            database containing all the known information about our members
            spread out in different spreadsheet files. For this project, I
            cleaned the different datasets with R or in Excel and formatted the
            data across the different files.
