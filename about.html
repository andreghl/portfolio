        <p>
          I am a BSc Economics and Business Economics student at Maastricht
          University. I have developed an interest in econometrics and statistics
          during my studies and I have accumulated some skills in  statistical 
          programming. This blog is a place to write about my interests and to showcase
          my abilities.

          <b><em>ArkeaTech - Bookkeeping</em></b>
          <br /><em> Sept 2021 - Mar 2022</em><br /><br>
          Our project was to help people aged 60+ who were
          uncomfortable with new technologies to develop the skills needed to
          use their digital products on their own. Unfortenately, our project
          suffered due to the Covid-19 crisis. We decided to discontinue the project in early 2022 to mitigate the
          risk of contamination (since we were dealing with a population at
          risk). This project was started thanks to the
          <a href="https://www.lje.be/fr">"Les Jeunes Entreprises"</a>
          initiative in Belgium.

          <b><em>Scope Maastricht - Database</em></b>
          <br /><em> Mar 2024 - Present </em><br /><br>
          Scope is the study association of the school of Business and Economics of Maastricht University.
          The aim of the database committee is to create a single database containing all the known information
          about our members spread out in different spreadsheet files. For this project, I cleaned the different
          datasets with R or in Excel and formatting the data across the different files.
